- ðŸ¥½ I'm a Chemical Physics graduate student in the [Friesner Group](https://friesner.chem.columbia.edu) at Columbia University. In the group, I mainly work on phaseless auxilary field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), focusing on systems containing transition metals. 
- ðŸ“· Outside of lab I'm also interested in photography. You can check out some of my works at my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/hufngvuowng/).
